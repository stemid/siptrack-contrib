# Exporting user keys

This is good as a backup for user keys until we solve other issues in Siptrackd that right now cause problems when connecting a user to a password key. 

The problems are often solved by restarting siptrackd but on rare occasions a user must be deleted from siptrack and re-synced with LDAP, in those cases it's good to have a backup of the users keys and a way to re-import them.
